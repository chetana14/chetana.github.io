[Extract Stock Sentiment From News Headlines](https://www.kaggle.com/chetna147/kernel184d384d2f)
<p>The project aims at generating investing insight by applying sentiment analysis on financial news headlines from FINVIZ.com. Using natural language processing technique, the model is trained to understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market feels good or bad about a stock. The news headlines for FB and TSLA are scraped and then sentiment analysis is applied to generate investment insight.</p>

[ASL Recognition with Deep Learning](https://github.com/chetana14/ASL-Recognition-with-Deep-Learning)
<p>American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures. In this project a computer vision systems is developed that translate sign language to spoken language.

[Na√Øve Bees: Deep Learning with Images](https://github.com/chetana14/Na-ve-Bees-Deep-Learning-with-Images)
<p>Pollinating bees have critical roles in both ecology and agriculture, and diseases like colony collapse disorder threaten these species. Identifying different species of bees in the wild means that we can better understand the prevalence and growth of these important insects.This project aims at identifying bee species from images is a task that ultimately would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data.</p>

[Predicting Credit Card Approvals](https://www.kaggle.com/chetna147/kernel73c7528630)
<p>Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays.</p>

[Mobile Games Ab-testing with Cookie Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/chetna147/kernel17f119fcd3)
<p>Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level.As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. In addition to driving in-app purchases, these gates serve the important purpose of giving players an enforced break from playing the game, hopefully resulting in that the player's enjoyment of the game being increased and prolonged.Initially the first gate was placed at level 30, this project analyzes an AB-test where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we look at the impact on player retention.
